title: Data Science - Making sense of data
---

## Hi! My name is Ramesh Sampath
I help people make sense of data.  I have built data warehouses and worked on BI projects for way more time than I would like to admit.  For programming, Python and some R-Statistics.  I attend conferences to meet people who have built applications or work in data science.  I hope to get there very shortly and plan to use this blog space to share my thoughts and ideas.

You can reach me @sampathweb in twitter / github.  If you wish, you can mail me ramesh at sampathweb.com
