    <h3>Hello.  I'm Ramesh</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I am an aspiring Data Scientist.  I try to make sense of data and find the stories.  I have built data warehouses and worked on BI projects in the past.  Recently, I have started with Python and the awesome data analysis pack (Numpy / Scikit / Pandas).
    <hr>
    I attend conferences to meet people who have built web apps or work in data science.  I hope to get there very shortly and plan to use this blog space to share my thoughts and ideas.
