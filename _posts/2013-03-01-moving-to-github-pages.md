# Moving my Blog to Github Pages:
For sometime now, I have had a blog on Wordpress.  I never put anything interesting to read, but it was out there if you looked me up online.  I would tell myself that I need to add content, but it never happened.  Now that my hosting is up for renewal, I decided to switch to Github pages.  I can just write plain text Markdown and Jekyll does the magic of converting it to a static html page.

With Twitter Bootstrap, I don't have to look for some magical wordpress theme to make me look cool.  I get to actually design my page the way I want it.  There are plenty of Jekyll themes in Jekyll wiki, but I decided to use the bootstrap base template from their getting started guide.  Now I understand the awesome grid system and how to make it work.  With help of youtube videos and other readings, I have now re-launched my blog.
